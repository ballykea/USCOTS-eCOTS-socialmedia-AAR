### Comments ###
* Kay writes on May 19: Either didn't have enough sleep last night or caffeine this morning - so I bet I entered some bad dates & times when I started this morning. Any dates you see in now with morning times from yesterday were actually today. And anything entered with time of 9:00AM is likely more between 8:30AM and 9:00AM. Oops, but not really a problem.
* Shelli mentioned on May 19: I had to estimate on times for Facebook and I think some of the people had repeats w/ FB and Twitter crossposting...
